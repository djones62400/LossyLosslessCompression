  <h3 id="rad">Lossless Compression</h3>
  <p>Lossless compression basically rewrites the data of the original file in a more efficient way. However, because no quality is lost, the resulting files are typically much larger than image and audio files compressed with lossy compression. For example, a file compressed using lossy compression may be one tenth the size of the original, while lossless compression is unlikely to produce a file smaller than half of the original size. Here are some advantages and disadvantages to lossless compression:
<ul>
<li> Lossless compression results in no loss in data, which means that it can be safely used for programs and text files </li></ul><ul><li>Lossless is suitable for software transfer, for example a zip file.</li></ul>
Some Disadvantages:
<ul>
Lossless compression does not reduce the file size as much as lossy, where non important data can afford to be lost.</p>
