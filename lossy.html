  <h3 id="rad">Lossy Compression</h3>
  <p>lossy compression or irreversible compression is the class of data encoding methods that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content. These techniques are used to reduce data size for storage, handling, and transmitting content. Here are some advantages and disadvantages to using lossy compression:
<ul>
<li> using lossy Compression results in a significantly reduced file size (smaller than lossless compression method), but it also means there is quality loss. </li></ul>
Some Disadvantages:
<ul><li>
the quality of the picture degrades with higher ratio of compression. You can't get the original quality back after compressing.</ul><ul>You cannot use lossy compression for data transfer for operations that require all data to function e.g. text document or software.</ul></li></p>
